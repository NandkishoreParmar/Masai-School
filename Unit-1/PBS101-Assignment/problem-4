Pseudo Code:
Algorithm to calculate  to find speed and check the given condition 
input: two variable distance and time 
output: Apply Brakes or Keep Going  based on the given condition

begin: 
     calculate speed 
     speed = distance/time

     if the speed is greater than 40
       if speed > 40 
       print("Apply Brake")
       else
       print("Keep Going")
end
