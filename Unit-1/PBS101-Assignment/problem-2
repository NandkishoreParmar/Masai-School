Pseudo Code:
Algorithm to calculate area of rectangle and perimeter of rectangle 
input: four variable L1, B1, L2, B2
output: true or false based on the given condition

begin: 
      calculate area of rectangle
      area of rectangle1 = L1 * B1
      area of rectangle2 = L2 * B2

      calculate perimeter of rectangle
      perimeter of rectangle1 = (L1 + B1)*2
      perimeter of rectangle2 = (L2 + B2)*2

      area of rectangle1 > area of rectangle2
      if area of rectangle1 is greater than area of rectangle2
      print("true")
      Else
      print("false")

      perimeter of rectangle1 > perimeter of rectangle2
      if perimeter of rectangle1 is greater than  perimeter of rectangle2
      print("true")
      Else
      print("false")
end
