### Problem Description

You are given two numbers, stored in variables with the names `fuel` and `distance`. You must calculate the value of `required`, determined by the product of `fuel` and `distance`. If `required` is greater than 50, the output should indicate that you have enough fuel, otherwise, you should continue the journey.

### Input

**Input Format:**
A single line containing two values, representing the amount of fuel and the distance to be covered.

**Constraints:**

- Both numbers are less than 1000.

### Output

**Output Format:**
Print "Enough" if the `required` fuel is greater than 50, else print "Go On".

### Sample Input 1

Pseudo Code:
Algorithm to calculate  to find required fuel  and check the given condition 
input: two variable fuel and distance  
output:  Enough or Go On based on the given condition

begin: 
     calculate required fuel
     required = fuel * distance

     if the `required` fuel is greater than 50
       if required > 50 
       print("Enough")
       else
       print("Go On")
end
