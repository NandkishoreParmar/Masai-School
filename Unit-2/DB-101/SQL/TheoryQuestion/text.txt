1. What is a database?
Ans. A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. 
It is used to store and retrieve information efficiently.

2. What is DBMS?
Ans. DBMS (Database Management System) is software that is used to manage databases. It provides an interface for 
users to interact with the database by entering, editing, and querying data.

3.What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
Ans. DBMS manages databases, while RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that stores
 data in a structured format using tables. RDBMS uses SQL for data manipulation.

4. What is SQL?
Ans. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to interact with databases. It is used for tasks
 such as querying data, updating data, and creating databases and tables.

5.What is MySQL?
Ans. MySQL is a popular open-source RDBMS that is based on SQL. It is commonly used for web applications to store 
and retrieve data.

6. What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
Ans. SQL is a language used to interact with databases, while MySQL is a specific implementation of an RDBMS that
 uses SQL.

7. What is Tables in SQL?
Ans. Tables in SQL are structures that store data in rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity, 
and each row represents a record of that entity.

8. Explain Different data types in SQL with example.
Ans. Data types in SQL define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a table. Examples include 
INTEGER (for whole numbers), VARCHAR (for variable-length character strings), and DATE (for dates).

9. Explain different Constraints in SQL with example.
Ans. Constraints in SQL are rules that enforce limits or conditions on data in a table. Examples include
 PRIMARY KEY (to uniquely identify rows), FOREIGN KEY (to enforce referential integrity), and NOT NULL 
 (to ensure a column cannot contain NULL values).

10. Explain about CRUD operation and its importance in Database?
Ans. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are essential for managing data in a 
database. Create is used to add new data, Read is used to retrieve data, Update is used to modify existing data,
 and Delete is used to remove data. These operations ensure data integrity and consistency in a database.
